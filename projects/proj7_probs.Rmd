1.  How can you tell if an object is a tibble? (Hint: try printing mtcars, which is a regular data frame). <br> <br> 

2. Practice referring to non-syntactic names in the following data frame by:
```{r eval = FALSE}
annoying <- tibble(
  `1` = 1:10,
  `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`))
)
```
    
  - Extracting the variable called 1.
  - Plotting a scatterplot of 1 vs 2.
  - Creating a new column called 3 which is 2 divided by 1.
  - Renaming the columns to one, two and three. <br> <br> 
3. What option controls how many additional column names are printed at the footer of a tibble? <br> <br>
