# Books

Below are listed what are in my opinion the best books on R programming.  All of these are freely available online and can be accessed by clicking on the book images below.

At the time of this writing, there are over 250 books listed in this repository, which span a wide range of topics (r programming, shiny app development, statistics, machine learning, sports analytics, etc.).
