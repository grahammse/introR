# Relational Data Overview
]

- Functions in this module will be used to combine multiple tables of data <br> <br>
- **Relational data**: multiple tables of data that are defined by the relations between them
   - dataset1 has IDs, demographics, and treatment assignment
   - dataset2 has IDs and outcomes <br> <br>
- Three families of verbs designed to work with relational data
   1. **Mutating joins**: add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another
   1. **Filtering joins**: filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table
   1. **Set Operations**: treat observations as if they were set elements

# Keys!

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("r-project"), scale = 3, fill = "white")`

.center[
# Key Variables
]

- **Keys**: the variables used to connect each pair of tables
   - A variable (or set of variables) that uniquely identifies an observation
- In simple cases, a single variable is sufficient to identify an observation
   - each plane is uniquely identified by `tailnum`
- In more complex cases, multiple variables are needed to identify an observation
   - to identify an observation in `weather`, you need five variables: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin` <br> <br>
- Two types of keys
   - **Primary Key**: uniquely identifies an observation in its own table
      - e.g., `flights$tailnum` identifies each plane in the `planes` table
   - **Foreign Key**: uniquely identifies an observation in another table
      - e.g., `flights$tailnum` appears in the `flights` table where it matches each flight to a unique plane
- A primary key and the corresponding foreign key in another tabale form a **relation**


---

.center[
# Does this key uniquely identify an observation?
]

- Once you'd identified a primary key, it's good practice to verify that it uniquely identifes each observation
- You can use `count()` to do this:
   - `count()` will calculate the frequency of each instance of the primary key
   - if the frequency (`n`) is greater than 1, you haven't uniquely identified each observation

```{r}
planes %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```


---

.center[
# Surrogate Keys
]

- In rare instances, there is no primary key in a table
- You'll need to create a **surrogate key** in this instance
- Use `mutate()` and `row_number()`

```{r}
flights %>% mutate(key = row_number()) %>% select(tailnum, year, month, day, key) %>% head(5)
```



---

.center[
# Now You Try!
]

- Install the `Bahman` package
- Identify the keys in the Batting dataset <br> <br> <br>

- Install the `babynames` package
- Identify the keys in the babynames dataset <br> <br> <br>


---

.center[
# Solution
]

```{r cache=TRUE}
Lahman::Batting %>% 
  count(playerID, yearID, stint) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

```{r cache=TRUE}
babynames::babynames %>%
  count(year, sex, name) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```

# Mutating Joins!

`r icons::icon_style(icons::fontawesome("r-project"), scale = 3, fill = "white")`



---

.center[
# Overview of Mutating Joins
]

- Allow you to combine variables from two tables
   - first matches observations by their keys
   - then copies across variables from one table to the other
- Like `mutate()`, join functions add variables to the right
- Let's make a smaller flights dataset for presenation purposes

```{r}
flights2 <- flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
head(flights2, n = 3)
```



---

.center[
# left_join()
]

- `left_join()` is the most common join
- Adds new variables from a second table to the right of a first table
- Let's `left_join()` the `airlines` table to the `flights2` table

```{r}
flights2 %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>% 
  head(n = 5)
```


---

.center[
# How Do Joins Work?
]

.pull-left[
- Imagine we have two tables, `x` and `y`
   - colored columns = key variables
   - gray columns = values <br> <br>
- A join is a way to connect reach row in `x` to zero, one or more rows in `y`
- the diagram to the right shows each potential match as an intersection of lines <br> <br>
- In an actual join, matches will be indicated with dots.
   - The number of dots = the number of matches = the number of rows in the output.

# Inner Joins
]

.pull-left[
- The simplest type of join is an inner join <br> <br>
- An inner join matches pairs of observations whenever their keys are equal <br> <br>
- The output of an inner join is a new data frame that contains the key, the x values, and the y values. 
   - We use `by` to tell dplyr which variable is the key <br> <br>
- The most important property of an inner join is that unmatched rows are not included in the result.

# Outer Joins!
]

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Description]

- An **outer join** keeps observations that appear in at least one of the tables <br> <br>
- Three types of outer joins
   - **Left Join**: keeps all observations in `x`
      - Most commonly used join
   - **Right Join**: keeps all observations in y
   - **Full Join**:  keeps all observations in x and y <br> <br>
- These joins work by adding an additional “virtual” observation to each table. 
   - This observation has a key that always matches (if no other key matches), and a value filled with `NA`.

- Duplicate keys arise when the values in the key column in one or more tables are not unique <br> <br>
- Two scenarios

   - Both tables have duplicate keys
      - Most likely an error

# Defining Key Columns

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Default]

- The specification of the key variables in our `*_join()` statements can be more complex than we've used so far
   - By default, `by = NULL` uses all variables that appear in both tables (a natural join)

```{r}
flights2 %>% left_join(weather) %>% head(3) %>% select(1:13) %>% head(3) %>% knitr::kable("html")
```

]<!---->

.panel[.panel-name[by = "x"]

- We can also supply a character vector in common to both tables
- Note that the year variables are disambiguated in the output with a suffix

```{r}
flights2 %>% left_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>% head(3) %>% select(1:10) %>% head(3) %>% knitr::kable("html")
```


]<!---->

.panel[.panel-name[by = c("a" = "b")]

- If the key variables have different names in the two tables, use `by = c("a" = "b")`
   - Will match variable `a` in table `x` to variable `b` in table `y`

```{r}
flights2 %>% left_join(airports, c("dest" = "faa")) %>% head(n = 3) %>% select(1:10) %>% head(3) %>% knitr::kable("html")

# Filtering Joins
]
<br>
- Filtering joins match observations in the same was as mutating joins <br> <br>
- But filtering joins affect the observations, not the variables <br> <br>
- There are two types:
   - `semi_join(x, y)`:  Keeps all observations in `x` that have a match in `y`
   - `anti_join(x, y)`:  Drops all observations in `x` that have a match in `y`

---

.center[
# semi_join()
]

- Semi-joins are useful for matching filtered summary tables back to the original rows

.pull-left[
```{r}
top_dest <- flights %>% count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>% head(5)
top_dest
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
flights %>% semi_join(top_dest)
```
]

.center[
# semi_join
]

.pull-left[

- Figures to the right present a graphical depiction of a `semi_join()` <br> <br>
- Filter joins just search for matches across tables
   - Doesn't matter which observations match
   - Filtering joins never duplicate rows like mutating joins do <br> <br>
- Filtering joins will not add any new columns to `x`
