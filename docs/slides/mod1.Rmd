# Overview

# .center[History of R]

.right-column[
- R is a descendent of the S programming language
- S was developed at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1976
- S was designed for data analysis, but with the goal that *users* would become *developers*
- In 1988, the third version of S (S3) was rewritten in C and began to resemble the R language in use today.  
    - S4 was later released in 1998
- R was created in 1991 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman
- R was released using a GNU General Public License in 1995, ensuring that it would remain free and open source
- In 2001, R version 1.0.0 was released to the public
- The most recent version of R is 4.2.0, which was released on 2022-04-22

# R Syntaxes
]

.pull-left[
## Base R
- The original R syntax
- All the functionality that's pre-loaded when you open an R session
- Core packages: `base`, `compiler`, `datasets`, `graphics`, `grDevices`, `grid`, `methods`, `parallel`, `splines`, `stats`, `stats4`, `tcltk`, `tools`, `translations`, `utils`
.center[

]

.pull-right[
## Tidyverse
- Released in 2016
- A suite of add-on packages that follow a coherent programming style
- Core packages: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, `forcats`

# Objects, Functions, and Packages
]

.pull-left[
- **Object** - A named listing of information that you can call up
  - can be a single number, a plot, a dataframe, a model, etc.
  -  in R, everything is an object!
- **Function** - an encoded set of instructions for acting upon objects
  - e.g., `mean`, `sum`, `plot`, etc.
  - functions are also objects!
- **Package** - a collection of functions that are bundled together
  - typically, functions in a pacakge accomplish a similar set of tasks
  - e.g., `ggplot2` is a package (bundle of functions) that is focused on data visualization

# Where Do Packages Come From?
]

.pull-left[
- Packages are developed by R users
- They're submitted and stored on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) for public use
- Other R users can then download those packages onto their own computers (using `install.packages`)
- To use the functions within a package, the package needs to be loaded during an R session (using `require` or `library`)
]

.pull-right[
<br>
<br>
<br>
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

<br>

```{r eval = FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Concluding Remarks


---
.center[
# Where have we been?
]

.pull-left[
<br>
- R is a free and **open source** statistcal software
- **R users** are also **R developers**
- R developers create **packages** of **functions** that are uploaded onto **CRAN**
- We (R users) can download those packages from CRAN onto our computers
- R studio is an **integrated development environment** that has helpful tools and features that make using R easier
- We'll use R Studio to communicate with R and use the cool stuff that R developers have created to **create cool stuff** of our own
