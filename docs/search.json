R for Data\nScience will serve as the primary text for this course. It’s available\nfor free online,\nbut well-worth the cost for the paper copy.\nThe Modules\nheading contains most of the course lecture content. You’ll find all\npresentations/lecture notes here.\nThe Project\nProblems heading contains all of the practice projects\nproblems.\nThe Project\nSolutions heading contains all of the solutions to the\npractice projects problems. I’ll add these solutions to the website\nabout 24 hours before the next week’s lecture so that you have an\nopportunity to try out the problems yourself before viewing the\nsolutions.\nLectures\nLectures will take place via Microsoft Teams every Friday at 10:00 AM\nPST starting June 10, 2022.\n\n\n\n",
