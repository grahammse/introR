R for Data Science will serve as the primary text for this course. It’s available for free online, but well-worth the cost for the paper copy.\nThe Modules heading contains most of the course lecture content. You’ll find all presentations/lecture notes here.\nThe Project Problems heading contains all of the practice projects problems.\nThe Project Solutions heading contains all of the solutions to the practice projects problems. I’ll add these solutions to the website about 24 hours before the next week’s lecture so that you have an opportunity to try out the problems yourself before viewing the solutions.\nLectures\nLectures will take place via Microsoft Teams every Friday at 10:00 AM PST starting June 10, 2022.\n\n\n\n",
