For this exercise, you'll continue to explore the General Social Survey data set that we worked on in lecture.  Load the `tidyverse`.  The General Social Survey data set can be found using `gss_cat`. 

<br> <br>



1.  What is the most common relig in this survey? Whatâ€™s the most common partyid?

<br> <br>

2.  Which relig does denom (denomination) apply to? How can you find out with a table? How can you find out with a visualization?

<br> <br>

3.  For each factor in gss_cat identify whether the order of the levels is arbitrary or principled.

<br> <br>

4.  How have the proportions of people identifying as Democrat, Republican, and Independent changed over time?

<br> <br>

5. How could you collapse rincome into a small set of categories?
